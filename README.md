# PhotoFlow

Welcome to our React Native app project! This app is designed to provide users with a visually engaging platform to share and explore photos. With features like a home feed, profile tabs, and a splash screen, it offers a comprehensive social media experience focused on visual content.

## Features

- **Home Feed**: Users can scroll through a curated list of photos shared by others. Each photo comes with information about the user who posted it. See [`HomePage.tsx`]for implementation details.

- **Profile Tab**: Offers a personalized view where users can see their own posts and manage their profile. Implemented in two versions: [`ProfileTab.tsx`] and [`ProfileTab.tsx`], with the latter including additional features like error handling for profile pictures.

- **Splash Screen**: A visually appealing splash screen that displays while the app is loading. Implemented in `Splash.tsx`
